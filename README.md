This is probably the first *big* thing I made in programming (having more than
1200 lines), in late 2009 (October if I remember). I think that it was a pretty
good jog for someone with only three hexamesters of experience with any kind of 
programming :) having many options on the menu and extra modes and cheats. 

I finished it in about a week and haven't modified anything since then. It still
has some bugs if I remember, but I'm not going to touch on it anymore. Feel
free to fork and make pull requests if you want, although I doubt anyone
will be interested in Pascal nowadays.

=== **Making it run** ===

- Download and compile it using Turbo Pascal 7.0 (I don't even have a copy of it
anymore)
- Set the console window size to 80x50.
- Put fullscreen on.
- Enjoy :)
